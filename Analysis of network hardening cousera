Security Risk Assessment Report

Part 1: Hardening Tools and Methods to Implement

To mitigate the identified security vulnerabilities and protect the organization's network from future attacks, the following security hardening practices should be implemented:

Enforce Strong Password Policies and Prevent Password Sharing

Require employees to use complex passwords with a minimum length of 12 characters, including uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.

Implement password expiration policies requiring employees to change their passwords every 60-90 days.

Educate employees on the risks of password sharing and enforce policies to prevent this practice.

Change Default Admin Passwords and Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Immediately change all default passwords, especially for critical systems such as databases, administrative accounts, and network devices.

Use a password manager to generate and store strong, unique passwords securely.

Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to ensure that employees only have access to the resources necessary for their job functions.

Enhance Network Security with Firewall Rules and Multifactor Authentication (MFA)

Configure firewalls to enforce strict rules that filter both inbound and outbound traffic based on security policies.

Enable logging and monitoring of firewall activity to detect potential threats in real time.

Require MFA for all employee logins, especially for administrative and high-privilege accounts, to provide an extra layer of security.

Part 2: Explanation of Recommended Security Hardening Practices

Enforcing Strong Password Policies and Preventing Password Sharing

Effectiveness: This measure reduces the likelihood of credential-based attacks, such as brute force or credential stuffing. It ensures that passwords cannot be easily guessed or compromised.

Implementation Frequency: Password policies should be enforced continuously, with automated reminders for password updates every 60-90 days.

Changing Default Admin Passwords and Implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Effectiveness: Default passwords are a well-known vulnerability exploited by attackers. Changing them immediately minimizes unauthorized access risks, and RBAC ensures users only access the necessary data, reducing insider threats.

Implementation Frequency: Default passwords should be changed immediately upon system setup, and RBAC policies should be reviewed and updated at least quarterly.

Enhancing Network Security with Firewall Rules and Multifactor Authentication (MFA)

Effectiveness: Firewalls filter malicious traffic, reducing exposure to cyber threats. MFA adds an additional layer of protection, making unauthorized access significantly harder, even if passwords are compromised.

Implementation Frequency: Firewall rules should be reviewed monthly or after any network infrastructure changes. MFA should be enforced organization-wide and reviewed regularly for compliance.

By implementing these security hardening techniques, the organization will significantly reduce the risk of data breaches and enhance overall network security.
